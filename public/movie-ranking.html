<h1>The best movies according to me</h1>
<h2>These are some of my favorite movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>I really wish the sequel was out already, but I support writers getting paid</p>
<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>The best movie of the best series!</p>
<h3>Short Term 12</h3>
<p>A heartwarming tale about a group home starring Brie Larson</p>
<h3>Mad Max: Fury Road</h3>
<p>Completely bonkers. The film is frenetic from the get-go and doesn't let up until it's over. Beautiful cinematography contrasts with the dark and ugly themes of the post-apocalypse.</p>
